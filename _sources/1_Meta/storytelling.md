# Storytelling with data

Insights from EDA

https://datatalks.club/blog/data-narrative.html

    > issue is not the quality of the insights, it is the lack of a story

3 essential parts:
1. characters: who is the data about, who does the conclusion impact?
1. conflicts: the heroes journey; what's the problem, pain point wanna to solve
1. conclusion: how conflicts gets resolved - happy ending or bad?

Set the hook in the Intro.
