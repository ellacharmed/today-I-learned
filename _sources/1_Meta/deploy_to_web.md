# Free Hosting platforms

Compiled by BingChat

Sites with free domains to share ML projects.

There are several free hosting platforms that you can use to deploy a basic Flask app for educational practice and portfolio showcase. Some of these platforms include:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/)
- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
- [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/)

Each of these platforms has its own set of features and limitations, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs. For example, Vercel offers Git integration, custom domains, and the ability to deploy and manage multiple versions of your app. Qovery offers Git integration with auto-deploy, great community support, and inbuilt database integration. PythonAnywhere offers Git integration and ease of deployment, but does not allow custom domains on its free plan. Azure App Service is a fully managed web hosting service that supports Python 3.7 and higher apps hosted in a Linux server environmentÂ¹.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
