# Hello World

Hello, everyone!

Welcome to the little corner of the world where I write about my learning journey to be an AI / ML Engineer. First step is to qualify for the AI Apprenticeship Programme run by AI Singapore.


This is the interim blogosphere while I figure out some tech stuff. Mainly on how to properly document like an academic researcher (using Jupyter-book) and then finally to productionize the Machine Learning models with MLOps.

To that end, as of the time this post is published (May 2023), I'm currently taking these courses:

AI300 deploying machine learning models by Heicoders Academy

DataTalks.club's MLOps Zoomcamp


I have also been documenting my daily successes and struggles with the #100DaysOfMLCode #LearnInPublic tags.

Feel free to comment here or connect with me.
