# Git Worktree according to BingChat


### Q: Can you explain `git worktree` like I'm 5?

BingChat: Sure! Imagine you have a big coloring book with lots of pages. Each page is like a branch in Git. You can color one page at a time, but sometimes you want to color two pages at the same time. `git worktree` is like having two copies of the same coloring book. You can color one page in one book and another page in the other book at the same time! And when you're done coloring, you can put all the pages together in one big book.

Does that make sense? üòä


### Q: How do I use git worktree?

BingChat: According to web search results, `git worktree` allows you to manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository. This means you can check out multiple branches at the same time by maintaining multiple clones of the same repository‚Å¥.

To create a new worktree, navigate to the root directory of the Git repository where you want to create a new work tree. Then run the command `git worktree add <path>`, where `<path>` is the path to the new working tree that you want to create. After running the command, Git will create a new working tree associated with the specified branch¬π.

### Q: is git branch still necessary after activating git add worktree <new-feature>?

BingChat: According to web search results, the branch is necessary because you cannot have the same branch checked out in different worktrees at the same time. So if you do not specify a branch when adding the worktree, then git will add one automatically, based on your current branch and with the name of the worktree directory¬π.

### Q1. Do I have to be _in_ the repo folder or outside of my repo folder path when I invoke the `git worktree add <path>` command? 

BingChat A1. You should navigate to the root directory of the Git repository where you want to create a new work tree before invoking the `git worktree add <path>` command.

### Q2. Is the path the same as the branch name or can be different, ie is `<path>` meant to be describing the intention of the work like <feature-name> like for naming branches? 

BingChat A2. The `<path>` argument specifies the path to the new working tree that you want to create. It can be different from the branch name. In its simplest form, `git worktree add <path>` automatically creates a new branch whose name is the final component of `<path>`, which is convenient if you plan to work on a new topic.

### Q3. And what is the command if I want the worktree to be for the `fix-typo` branch that I already have? Do I have to be in this branch before invoking `git worktree add fixing-typos`

BingChat A3. If you want to work on an existing branch in a new worktree, you can use `git worktree add <path> <branch>`. For example, if you want to create a new worktree for the `fix-typo` branch, you can use the command `git worktree add fixing-typos fix-typo`.

### Q: Let me recap to confirm my understanding, using `git worktree` means I don't have to stash my work-in-progress that I'm not ready to commit yet, before switching to a different "tree" versus a "branch" where the `git status` command requires the working tree to be clean before git allows me to checkout to another branch?

BingChat: Yes, that's correct! `git worktree` allows you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without having to stash your work-in-progress. Each worktree has its own working tree, so you can switch between them without having to clean your working tree before switching branches. This can be useful if you need to work on a hotfix or another task while in the middle of another task.

### Q: How to switch to a different worktree?

BingChat: To switch to a different worktree, you can simply change the directory to the path of the worktree you want to switch to. For example, if you have a worktree at the path `../fixing-typos`, you can use the command `cd ../fixing-typos` to switch to that worktree.

### Q: Does cd to a different folder also automatically checkout the branch if there's one?

BingChat: No, using the `cd` command to change directories does not automatically checkout a branch. When you create a new worktree using `git worktree add <path> <branch>`, Git will checkout the specified branch in the new worktree. After that, you can use the `cd` command to switch between worktrees, and each worktree will remain on the branch that was checked out when it was created.

### Q: how do I clean up worktrees after I'm done?

BingChat: When you are done with a linked worktree, you can remove it using the `git worktree remove <worktree>` command, where `<worktree>` is the path to the worktree you want to remove¬≥. This will remove the worktree and its associated metadata from the repository.

If a working tree is deleted without using `git worktree remove`, then its associated administrative files will eventually be removed automatically, or you can run `git worktree prune` in the main or any linked worktree to clean up any stale administrative files¬≥.

### Q: does merging and pushing a <branch> generated by using the `git worktree add <path> <branch>` command also push the whole folder structure to the remote?

BingChat: No, using `git worktree add <path> <branch>` does not affect the remote repository. It only creates a new worktree on your local machine that is associated with the specified branch.

When you merge and push changes from a branch that was checked out in a worktree, only the changes to the files in the repository are pushed to the remote, not the entire folder structure of the worktree. The worktree itself is not part of the repository and is not tracked by Git.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

### Q: What is the correct sequence? `git merge branch` first or `git worktree remove <worktree>` first?

BingChat: The correct sequence would be to merge the changes from the branch associated with the worktree first, and then remove the worktree using `git worktree remove <worktree>`.

Here's an example sequence of commands:

1. `cd <worktree>` to switch to the worktree directory.
2. `git add .` and `git commit -m "commit message"` to stage and commit your changes in the worktree.
3. `cd <main repository>` to switch back to the main repository directory.
4. `git merge <branch>` to merge the changes from the branch associated with the worktree into your current branch.
5. `git worktree remove <worktree>` to remove the worktree.
