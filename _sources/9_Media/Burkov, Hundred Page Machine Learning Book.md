(page xvii) Preface. 

> _machines don’t learn_

**“Machine learning” is not learning. **
It is a marketing term being popularized and entered our lexicon just like “googling” means searching the Internet.
Term coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959.
It is now the accepted term to mean a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Science, Engineering and Computing; capable of doing tasks without the traditional rule-based algorithms of procedural programming.
