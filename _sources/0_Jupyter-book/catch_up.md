# Summary of important jb concepts

## publish to github pages

Caveat to using gh-pages: `main` repo must be public. 

1. Generate toc `jupyter-book toc from-project . > _toc.yml`
1. Remove sections from _toc to be kept private (confidential, sensitive data or private projects)
1. Build book `jb build .`
1. Push to gh-pages `ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html/`

## book vs article

The TOC has a line stating `jb-book` and `jb-article`. 
- How does it know if md is a book or article? 
- How do I format it differently?
- Is it only for the `jb build` command? Using a folder for book and file for article.
- [ ] TODO The used terms like Chapters and Sections but then the toc has no chapters but section in newer versions.

## the _toc.yml

- can be autogenerated, but then the `excluded-contents` need to be removed manually
  - [ ] TODO is there a way to auto-exclude like .gitignore and .dockerignore?
  - docs show {toggle} and other directives for {cell} to be toggle-ble or hidden but not for whole chapters and files. Need more research
- or craft it manually each time a new file is created. Tedious process if add multiple files in a day
- rename landing.md to index.md so each 'parent' Section header has some text description to explain its purpose and it's automatically picked up. No need to explicitly include the 'index.md' file in _toc

## the _config.yml

- change `only_build_toc_files : true` (default: false) to exlude any pages (private, or not ready) from _toc and the page would not be included by the `build` script.
- change the `book.tex` entry under `latex` section to the preffered book-name.


## add yaml metadata to MySt notebooks

`jupyter-book myst init path/to/markdownfile.md`
