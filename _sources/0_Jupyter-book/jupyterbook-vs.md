# JupyterBook vs READMEs vs Wikis

## About READMEs

You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.

For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see "Adding a code of conduct to your project" and "Setting up your project for healthy contributions."

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

* What the project does
* Why the project is useful
* How users can get started with the project
* Where users can get help with your project
* Who maintains and contributes to the project

## About Wikis

Search engines will not index the contents of wikis. To have your content indexed by search engines, you can use GitHub Pages in a public repository.
