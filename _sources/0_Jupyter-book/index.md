# Jupyter-book

## Synopsis

This chapter collects all the information on learning [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html#).

## Topics to learn

In order to use  jupyter-books effectively, need to learn and know these tools:

* sphinx
* MyST Markdown
* Latex
* bash


## Guides

* {doc}how to by Chris Holdgraf
* [Dr Patrick Mineault's Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/)
* [turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html)


## Things to research

* TODO unify filename conventions: use dashes or underscores
* TODO unify filenames if there's media i.e "author, topic"
* TODO how to keep track of _old_ (untouched for long time since creation), _dead_ (disconnected nodes in graph) pages if no datetimestamp in frontmatter?

```{warning}
cannot build book when TODOs in headings?
