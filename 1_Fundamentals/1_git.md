# Git and Github

My notes on `git` goes here.

Basic commands

* `git clone <url-to-remote-repo> .`
  while in the directory `<current dir>`, clone the linked repo to `<current dir>`

* `git status`
  show current branch and status of files in the directory
  
* `git push origin master`
  push to remote `<origin>` repo the local `<master>` branch into the similarly named remote branch
